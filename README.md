# Aquarium Amplicon NGS Prep

A workflow for prepping [yeast display](https://github.com/dvnstrcklnd/aq-yeast-display/edit/master/README.md) libraries for NGS using Aquarium. Originally developed for [massively parallel measurement of protein stability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706065), but can be used for other applications that primarily preparative qPCR.
